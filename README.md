### IF.05.22 Theoretical Informatics -- Winter 2017
# Assignment 1: Coding Assignment

## Objective
This week's assignment is to get you familiar with Java, repeat recursion and easy algorithmic stuff.

## Materials
- NetBeans IDE.

## Required Tasks
1. Write a Java program that calculates the gcd by calculating the the product of the common prime implicants
2. Write a Java program that calculates the gcd by using the Euclidean algorithm using the mod operator as presented in class

## Hints
1. Clone your personal repository to your computer.
2. Create and check out a new branch named after your last name and your first name separated by a dash. Remove umlauts and other diacritics from your name. Example: if your name is *Alfred Wöß* then your branch name should be `woesz-alfred`.
3. Create your NetBeans project. Use one project and create two methods `gcdPrimeFactors(int a, int b)` and `gcdEucledian(int a, int b)`. In the `main` method you test both of them with the same values. Make more test samples.
4. Commit your solution to your branch.
5. Make a pull request to the main repository.

## Evaluation
When you make a pull request your cheat sheet will be graded. Most common reasons to mark down a solution would be
- One or more of the *Required Tasks* section are not satisfied
- Submitted code is visually sloppy and hard to read
